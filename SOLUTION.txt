SATOSHI'S TREASURE - EARTH KEY #6 SOLUTION
============================================

Puzzle: Earth Key (ST-0006)
Released: May 12, 2019
Status: Unsolved for 6+ years
Solved: November 16, 2025

THE SOLUTION
------------

Two barcodes discovered in encrypted regions:

Right Barcode: I2/5:500077
Left Barcode:  I2/5:965642
Combined:      500077965642

GEOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION (Most Likely)
---------------------------------------

Coordinates: 50.0077°N, 9.65642°E
Location:    Main-Kinzig-Kreis, Hesse, Germany
Distance:    ~50km from Frankfurt Airport
Area:        Near Strandbad Kinzigsee beach

This matches the puzzle title "Breakbeats on the Beach" and the name "Earth Key".
Players would travel to this location to retrieve the actual ST-0006 key fragment.

PASSPHRASES (from Luke 12:2)
-----------------------------

Layer 1: "nothing is covered" (lowercase)
         Decrypts full image (1950x2956 pixels)

Layer 2: "that will not be revealed"
         Decrypts both diagonal regions containing barcodes

Layer 3: "or hidden that will not be known"
         Decoy passphrase for center region (no barcode)

STEP-BY-STEP
------------

1. Decrypt full image:
   magick quickbrownfox-doll.bmp -decipher "nothing is covered" layer1.png

2. Extract and decrypt right diagonal:
   magick layer1.png -crop 1700x800+100+100 right.png
   magick right.png -decipher "that will not be revealed" right_dec.png
   zbarimg right_dec.png
   → I2/5:500077

3. Extract and decrypt left diagonal:
   magick layer1.png -crop 700x800+0+100 left.png
   magick left.png -decipher "that will not be revealed" left_dec.png
   zbarimg left_dec.png
   → I2/5:965642

WHY IT WENT UNSOLVED
--------------------

1. People combined the clue into one passphrase
2. Case sensitivity (must be lowercase)
3. Focus on obvious center region (which is a decoy)
4. Didn't check both diagonal regions
5. Order matters: decrypt full image FIRST, then crop regions

KEY INSIGHTS
------------

- Three passphrases from grammatical structure of Luke 12:2
- Two barcodes (nesting doll theme!)
- Geographic coordinates for physical retrieval
- Symmetric regions (check both left and right)
- Case sensitivity matters

TOOLS REQUIRED
--------------

ImageMagick (for decryption)
ZBar (for barcode scanning)
