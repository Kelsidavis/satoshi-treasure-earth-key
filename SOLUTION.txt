SATOSHI'S TREASURE - EARTH KEY #6 SOLUTION
============================================

Puzzle: Earth Key (ST-0006)
Released: May 12, 2019
Status: Unsolved for 6+ years
Solved: November 16, 2025

THE SOLUTION
------------

Two barcodes discovered in encrypted regions:

Right Barcode: I2/5:500077
Left Barcode:  I2/5:965642
Combined:      500077965642

GEOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION (Speculative)
---------------------------------------

Coordinates: 50.0077°N, 9.65642°E
Location:    Southwest of Gemünden am Main, Main-Spessart district, Bavaria, Germany
Nearby:      Sindersbachsee bathing lake (~6-7 km away)

The name "Earth Key" and two 6-digit numbers suggest geographic coordinates.
The puzzle title "Breakbeats on the Beach" hints at a beach location - there are
bathing lakes (Badeseen) with beach facilities in this area of Bavaria.

Likely scenario: Players would travel to these coordinates (or nearby) to retrieve
the actual ST-0006 key fragment from a geocache or field agent. The exact intended
destination is unknown.

PASSPHRASES (from Luke 12:2, first clause only)
-------------------------------------------------

The clue "first three words, and then last 5 words" refers to the
FIRST CLAUSE only: "Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed,"

Layer 1: "nothing is covered" (lowercase)
         First 3 words of first clause
         Decrypts full image (1950x2956 pixels)

Layer 2: "that will not be revealed"
         Last 5 words of first clause
         Decrypts both diagonal regions containing barcodes

STEP-BY-STEP
------------

1. Decrypt full image:
   magick quickbrownfox-doll.bmp -decipher "nothing is covered" layer1.png

2. Extract and decrypt right diagonal:
   magick layer1.png -crop 1700x800+100+100 right.png
   magick right.png -decipher "that will not be revealed" right_dec.png
   zbarimg right_dec.png
   → I2/5:500077

3. Extract and decrypt left diagonal:
   magick layer1.png -crop 700x800+0+100 left.png
   magick left.png -decipher "that will not be revealed" left_dec.png
   zbarimg left_dec.png
   → I2/5:965642

WHY IT WENT UNSOLVED
--------------------

1. People misinterpreted "last 5 words" as the entire verse
   instead of the first clause only
2. Most people tried "that will not be known" (second clause)
   instead of "that will not be revealed" (first clause)
3. Case sensitivity (must be lowercase)
4. Didn't check both diagonal regions
5. Order matters: decrypt full image FIRST, then crop regions

KEY INSIGHTS
------------

- "First three words, and then last 5 words" = first clause only
- First clause: "Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed,"
- Two passphrases from grammatical structure
- Two barcodes in symmetric diagonal regions (nesting doll theme!)
- Geographic coordinates for physical retrieval
- Case sensitivity matters

TOOLS REQUIRED
--------------

ImageMagick (for decryption)
ZBar (for barcode scanning)
